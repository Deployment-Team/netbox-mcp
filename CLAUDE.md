# Claude Instructions for NetBox MCP Server

## Communication Language Guidelines

- **Human Communication**: Always communicate with the user in Dutch
- **Code & Documentation**: All code, documentation, comments, commit messages, and GitHub-related content must be in English
- **Reason**: This maintains accessibility for the international open-source community while allowing natural communication with the Dutch-speaking project maintainer

## Project Context

This is a NetBox MCP (Model Context Protocol) server - a Python project that provides an interface between Large Language Models and NetBox network documentation and IPAM systems. It's an enterprise-grade read/write server that allows LLMs to interact with NetBox data such as devices, racks, IP addresses, and network infrastructure.

The project is hosted as a public repository on GitHub under the Deployment Team organization.

## Development Guidelines

- Always use English for:
  - Code comments and docstrings
  - README, documentation files
  - Git commit messages
  - GitHub issues/PRs
  - Error messages and logs
  - Configuration examples

- Maintain Dutch for:
  - Direct communication with the user
  - Explanations of what you're doing
  - Questions about requirements

## Key Architecture Components

### Self-Describing Server Architecture
The NetBox MCP follows Gemini AI's architectural recommendations:

- **Tool Registry System** (`netbox_mcp/registry.py`): Core @mcp_tool decorator with automatic function inspection
- **Dependency Injection** (`netbox_mcp/dependencies.py`): Thread-safe singleton client management resolving circular imports
- **Plugin Architecture** (`netbox_mcp/tools/`): Automatic tool discovery with clean module separation
- **Foreign Key Resolution**: Intelligent slug/name to ID conversion for all NetBox relationships
- **Enterprise Safety**: confirm=True, dry-run mode, comprehensive error handling, audit logging

### Production Hardening Features
- **Secrets Management** (`netbox_mcp/secrets.py`): Docker secrets, Kubernetes secrets, environment variables
- **Structured Logging** (`netbox_mcp/logging_config.py`): JSON formatting for ELK Stack compatibility
- **Performance Caching**: TTL-based caching with correlation IDs and performance timing
- **Health Endpoints**: `/health`, `/healthz`, `/readyz` for container orchestration
- **Graceful Degradation**: Server continues in degraded mode when NetBox unavailable
