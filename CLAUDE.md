# Claude Instructions for NetBox MCP Server

## Communication Language Guidelines

- **Human Communication**: Always communicate with the user in Dutch
- **Code & Documentation**: All code, documentation, comments, commit messages, and GitHub-related content must be in English
- **Reason**: This maintains accessibility for the international open-source community while allowing natural communication with the Dutch-speaking project maintainer

## Project Context

This is a NetBox MCP (Model Context Protocol) server - a Python project that provides an interface between Large Language Models and NetBox network documentation and IPAM systems. It's an enterprise-grade read/write server that allows LLMs to interact with NetBox data such as devices, racks, IP addresses, and network infrastructure.

The project is hosted as a public repository on GitHub under the Deployment Team organization.

## Development Guidelines

- Always use English for:
  - Code comments and docstrings
  - README, documentation files
  - Git commit messages
  - GitHub issues/PRs
  - Error messages and logs
  - Configuration examples

- Maintain Dutch for:
  - Direct communication with the user
  - Explanations of what you're doing
  - Questions about requirements

## Key Architecture Components

### Self-Describing Server Architecture
The NetBox MCP follows Gemini AI's architectural recommendations:

- **Tool Registry System** (`netbox_mcp/registry.py`): Core @mcp_tool decorator with automatic function inspection
- **Dependency Injection** (`netbox_mcp/dependencies.py`): Thread-safe singleton client management resolving circular imports
- **Plugin Architecture** (`netbox_mcp/tools/`): Automatic tool discovery with clean module separation
- **Foreign Key Resolution**: Intelligent slug/name to ID conversion for all NetBox relationships
- **Enterprise Safety**: confirm=True, dry-run mode, comprehensive error handling, audit logging

### Production Hardening Features
- **Secrets Management** (`netbox_mcp/secrets.py`): Docker secrets, Kubernetes secrets, environment variables
- **Structured Logging** (`netbox_mcp/logging_config.py`): JSON formatting for ELK Stack compatibility
- **Performance Caching**: TTL-based caching with correlation IDs and performance timing
- **Health Endpoints**: `/health`, `/healthz`, `/readyz` for container orchestration
- **Graceful Degradation**: Server continues in degraded mode when NetBox unavailable

### ðŸŽ‰ NEW: High-Level Enterprise Tools (v0.9.0 Development)

**Issue #25 COMPLETED** - First high-level enterprise tool implemented:

#### âœ… `netbox_provision_new_device` - Complete Device Provisioning

**Revolutionary high-level function** that reduces 5-6 API calls into one logical operation:

**Function Signature:**
```python
def netbox_provision_new_device(
    client: NetBoxClient,
    device_name: str,
    site_name: str, 
    rack_name: str,
    device_model: str,
    role_name: str,
    position: int,
    status: str = "active",
    face: str = "front", 
    tenant: Optional[str] = None,
    platform: Optional[str] = None,
    serial: Optional[str] = None,
    asset_tag: Optional[str] = None,
    description: Optional[str] = None,
    confirm: bool = False
) -> Dict[str, Any]
```

**8-Step Internal Workflow:**
1. **Site Lookup**: Find site by name/slug with validation
2. **Rack Lookup**: Find rack within site with validation  
3. **Device Type Resolution**: Resolve device model to device_type ID
4. **Role Resolution**: Resolve role name to device_role ID
5. **Position Validation**: Check rack height, position availability, device overlap
6. **Foreign Key Resolution**: Optional tenant/platform lookup
7. **Payload Assembly**: Complete device data with all resolved IDs
8. **Device Creation**: Atomic device creation with full audit trail

**Enterprise Features:**
- âœ… **Comprehensive Validation**: Position conflicts, rack height, device overlap
- âœ… **Foreign Key Resolution**: Automatic slug/name to ID conversion
- âœ… **Dry-Run Support**: Safe validation without actual creation  
- âœ… **Enterprise Safety**: Position conflict detection, overlap validation
- âœ… **Detailed Logging**: Complete audit trail with correlation IDs
- âœ… **Error Handling**: Specific error types (ValidationError, ConflictError, NotFoundError)

**Testing & Validation:**
- âœ… **Live Integration Testing**: Validated against NetBox 4.2.9 instance
- âœ… **Test Infrastructure**: Complete test data setup with `setup_test_data.py`
- âœ… **Comprehensive Testing**: Dry-run validation, device creation, conflict detection
- âœ… **Web UI Verification**: Device successfully created (ID: 11) and visible in NetBox UI
- âœ… **Test Data Preservation**: Setup scripts and dependencies maintained for future testing

**Test Results:**
```
âœ… Dry run validation: PASSED - All lookups and validations working
âœ… Device creation: PASSED - Device successfully created (ID: 11)  
âœ… Conflict detection: PASSED - Detects occupied rack positions correctly
ðŸ“± Web UI Verification: https://zwqg2756.cloud.netboxapp.com/dcim/devices/11/
```

**Value Proposition:**
This is the ultimate high-level function for data center provisioning workflows. It transforms complex multi-step device provisioning into a single, safe, validated operation perfect for LLM automation.
