# Ask Gemini: NetBox MCP Write Operations Architecture

## Context
We are implementing **safety-critical write operations** for a NetBox MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. This server enables Large Language Models to perform both read and write operations on NetBox instances (network documentation and IPAM systems). 

**CRITICAL SAFETY REQUIREMENT**: Write operations must be 100% safe with multiple layers of protection against accidental data corruption.

## Current Implementation Status
- âœ… **Read Operations**: Fully implemented and tested (8 MCP tools)
- âœ… **Docker Containerization**: Complete with health monitoring
- âœ… **Configuration System**: Comprehensive with safety configs
- âœ… **Exception Framework**: NetBox-specific error handling
- ðŸš§ **Write Operations**: Now implementing (Issue #6)

## Strategic Architecture Questions for Gemini

### 1. **Safety-First Write Operation Design**
We need to implement write operations with these safety mechanisms:
- Mandatory `confirm=True` parameter for all writes
- Global `NETBOX_DRY_RUN` mode for testing
- Comprehensive audit logging of all mutations
- Transaction-like rollback capabilities

**Question**: What's the most robust architecture pattern for implementing these safety layers? Should we use:
- A. Decorator pattern around each write method
- B. Safety wrapper class that encapsulates all write operations  
- C. Context manager for write transactions
- D. Different approach entirely?

### 2. **Write Method Architecture**
We're implementing these core write methods:
- `create_object(object_type, data, confirm=False)`
- `update_object(object_type, object_id, data, confirm=False)`  
- `delete_object(object_type, object_id, confirm=False)`

**Question**: For maximum flexibility and maintainability, should we:
- A. Use generic methods that work with any NetBox object type
- B. Create specific methods for each object type (create_device, create_site, etc.)
- C. Hybrid approach with both generic and specific methods
- D. Factory pattern for object-specific operations?

### 3. **Dry-Run Mode Implementation**
Dry-run mode should simulate write operations without actually modifying data.

**Question**: What's the best strategy for dry-run simulation?
- A. Mock the pynetbox API calls and return fake responses
- B. Execute read operations to validate, then return simulated success
- C. Create a complete dry-run simulation layer with state tracking
- D. Use a combination approach based on operation complexity?

### 4. **Error Handling and Rollback Strategy**
NetBox operations can fail partway through complex changes.

**Question**: For enterprise-grade reliability, should we:
- A. Implement manual rollback by storing "before" state and reversing changes
- B. Use database-style transactions (if NetBox API supports them)
- C. Design idempotent operations that can be safely retried
- D. Combination of approaches based on operation type?

### 5. **Logging and Audit Trail**
We need comprehensive logging for compliance and debugging.

**Question**: What's the optimal logging strategy?
- A. Structured JSON logs with before/after state for each operation
- B. Separate audit log file with detailed operation tracking
- C. Integration with external logging systems (ELK, Splunk, etc.)
- D. Multi-level logging (summary + detailed) with configurable verbosity?

### 6. **Testing Strategy for Write Operations**
Testing write operations safely against real NetBox instances is challenging.

**Question**: What's the best testing approach?
- A. Mock all write operations with comprehensive unit tests
- B. Use a dedicated test NetBox instance with real API calls
- C. Hybrid approach: mocks for unit tests, real instance for integration
- D. Contract testing with recorded API interactions?

### 7. **Future Idempotent Operations**
We'll later implement "ensure" methods (e.g., `ensure_device_exists`).

**Question**: Should we:
- A. Build idempotent logic into the basic write methods now
- B. Keep basic writes simple and add idempotent layer later
- C. Design a unified interface that supports both patterns
- D. Separate concerns completely between basic writes and ensure operations?

## Request for Gemini
Please provide architectural guidance on these questions, considering:
- **Enterprise-grade reliability** requirements
- **Safety-first** design principles  
- **Maintainability** for future development
- **Performance** for production usage
- **Testing** strategies for safety-critical code

Your expert insights would be invaluable for making the right architectural decisions early in this critical implementation phase.

## Current Code Context
- **Language**: Python 3.12
- **NetBox API**: pynetbox library (REST API wrapper)
- **Framework**: FastMCP for MCP server implementation
- **Safety Framework**: Already implemented confirmation and dry-run config classes
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive NetBox-specific exception hierarchy
- **Environment**: Docker containerized with health monitoring

Thank you for your architectural guidance! ðŸš€
