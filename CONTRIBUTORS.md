    * Responsible for the project vision, defining requirements, guiding development, and validating all outcomes. The driving force behind the project.

* **Lead Developer:** **Claude (AI Model)**
    * Responsible for writing the Python source code, implementing the high-level tools, and building out the test suites.

* **Architect & Technical Advisor:** **Gemini (AI Model)**
    * Responsible for the software architecture, designing the system structure, resolving complex architectural challenges (like circular imports and caching strategies), and advising on industry best practices.

## Inspiration and Acknowledgements

The foundational inspiration for this project came from the original `netbox-mcp-server` developed by NetBox Labs.

* **Original Project:** [https://github.com/netboxlabs/netbox-mcp-server](https://github.com/netboxlabs/netbox-mcp-server)

This project was started as a further development on the concepts pioneered by the original `netbox-mcp-server`. The specific goal was to engineer a more dynamic, scalable, and feature-rich architecture that could be controlled via a self-describing API, making it suitable for automation by systems like Large Language Models. We are grateful to NetBox Labs for laying the original groundwork.
